Made using pygame module and its basic functions.
The player navigates Pac-Man through a maze containing various dots, known as Pac-Dots, and four multi-colored ghosts: 
Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde. The goal of the game is to accumulate points by eating all the Pac-Dots in the maze,
completing that 'stage' of the game and starting the next stage and maze of Pac-dots. Between some stages, one of three intermission
animations plays.[25] The four ghosts roam the maze hunting for Pac-Man. If any one of the ghosts touches him, a life is lost;
when all lives have been lost, the game is over.
